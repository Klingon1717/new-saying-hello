//declaring hello to save the info from the prompt, so I can use it later.
//tried declaring hi, because it kept just saying nice to meet you and hi wasn't showing up. I know that's not correct.
//console.log to add them all up together.

var hello = prompt('What is your name\?');
console.log(hello);
var pre = ('Hello');
var saying =(' '+'\, Nice to meet you\!');

var greeting = pre + " " +hello + saying;
console.log(greeting);
// I remembered what I was doing. I'm trying to do it without looking at anything. I want to be able to just do this stuff. Stupidest thing though I can't get Hi to show up I tried several different things? So stupid, I know.. I've done this sooo many times before I don't know what's wrong with me.
